# StellarCyber-Scripts-Pro

StellarCyber-Scripts-Pro is a CLI-based menu interface with dynamic options loaded from a `config.json` file. It allows users to navigate through a menu structure, execute scripts, simulate actions, and display help information. It is the upgraded version of the basic [StellarCyber-Scripts](https://github.com/ash14545/StellarCyber-Scripts) project.

## To do

* **v2**: Manual (soon automatic) checks if user is on sensors, dp, etc. After selection, provide options accordingly.

## Features

* **Dynamic Menu**: Options are read from `config.json` using `jq` and display dynamically in a horizontal menu format.

* **Navigation**: Users can navigate the menu using arrow keys (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`) and select options using the `Enter` key.

* **Submenus**: Each main option can lead to a submenu with the following options: `Run`, `Help`, `Simulate`, `Back`.

* **Script Downloading**: Automatically downloads scripts from GitHub Gist URLs related to each option in `config.json` if they are missing locally.

* **ANSI Color Support**: Uses ANSI color codes for enhanced terminal display

## Requirements

Please ensure that you are running in a **Linux environment**. Windows users can use the [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/) CLI.

* `jq`: Required for parsing `config.json` and other json files and responses.
* `curl`: Required for downloading scripts from URLs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellarcyber/StellarCyber-Scripts-Pro.git
cd StellarCyber-Scripts-Pro
```

2. Ensure the script has the proper permissions to run

```bash
chmod +x master_script.sh
```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the interactive menu:

```
./master_script.sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the menu options, download scripts, and perform tasks.

## Configuration

##### TODO: add a bit more information on how to configure/add new scripts. maybe don't add a check for script urls so people can upload their own scripts into the tools directory and have it work from there (only for local use. global use will require uploading to repo with url).

* **config.json**: Contains options and URLs for downloading scripts. Modify this file to add new scripts or update existing ones.
